# SDK-Generated

an sdk generated for pubg.

thanks to Fox,  UnrealEngineSDKGenerator

if you have a suggestion on how to improve this sdk, please open an issue.

i will try to keep this up to date.
i am not repsonsible for how you use this.
do not ask me how to use this.
i do not guarantee it is perfectly aligned.
wise words from tj888:

Make sure to add in your Project both PUBG_Basic.cpp and PUBG_CoreUObject_functions.cpp

If you want to use engine functions (You are internal, WHY WOULDN'T YOU! haha) add both PUBG_Engine_functions.cpp and PUBG_TslGame_functions.cpp as well

Don't forget to complete the function GetGlobalNames() in PUBG_Basic.hpp and the function GetGlobalObjects() in PUBG_CoreUObject_classes.hpp
